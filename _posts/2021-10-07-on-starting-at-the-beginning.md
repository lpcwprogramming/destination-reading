When I was 10 years old I decided to be smart. At the time, books were synonymous with school, homework, and everything that was wrong with the world. And yet I'd decided to be smart and smart people read books, they even enjoyed them. So, one day at the mall, I wandered into a book store. It was small, but it was decently stocked. There was a bored twenty something girl behind the register, who I believed must know all the books in the place. This poor woman had no idea what to do when I asked her for a book.

"What kind of book?"

"You know...a book...for me...that's fun."

Bless her, she tried. She gave me a book that was very popular at the time, "The Prisoner of Azkaban" by J.K. Rowling. Never mind that it was the third book in a series I'd never read, which I found out halfway through the book. In any case, that moment marked the start of my love affair with books and everything literary.

I was the kid who read at lunch, at recess, between classes. Sometimes even during. Suffice it to say, my teachers were not impressed by me pulling out books in class or failing to put them away when they started class. My romance with books carried me all the way into a Comparative Literature degree. I spent my undergrad years reading books, studying and writing about them.

And then disaster struck. Grad school. Work. Life.

It's been a few years since I finished grad school and I still haven't been able to get into the same rhythm or any rhythm for that matter. This is actually the first year in a long time that I've read more than 10 books. Am I pleased with myself? Hell yeah! This blog was born from an effort to keep myself in track and self-satisfied.

Thanks for coming. Hope you enjoy your stay.
